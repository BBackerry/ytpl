## [YTPL](http://ytpl.ca/)

A Youtube playlists backup app written in PHP and built with the F3 micro-framework.

YTPL builds a history of names for videos in Youtube playlists so you can easily maintain your playlists. No more deleted or private videos in your vaporwave-micro-house-trap-chillout playlist !

This project is hosted at http://ytpl.ca/ (for free! as long as it doesn't break my bandwith cap...)
